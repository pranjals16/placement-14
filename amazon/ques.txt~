20 MCQ, 2 Coding - 90 mins Platform - Hackerrank
MCQs:
Which character can be used in variable name :  | , * , -, _    Ans(_)
Complexity of sorting n string of n length in lexicographic order using Merge Sort Ans: O(n^2 log n)
Bubble Sort Complexity Related: Ans: 400
#include : Preprocessing
N points are placed in a circle and shoot out alternate until end, which data structure is used for implementation. (Ans: Circular Linked List)
A Priority-Queue is implemfented as a Max-Heap. Initially, it has 5 elements. The level-order traversal of the heap is given below: 10, 8, 5, 3, 2 Two new elements "1" and "7" are inserted in the heap in that order. The level-order traversal of the heap after the insertion of the elements is: 
(a) 10, 8, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1         (b) 10, 8, 7, 2, 3, 1, 5 
(c) 10, 8, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5          (d) 10, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1, 5(ans)
Output of this code snnipet
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int num[]={1,4,8,12,16};
    int *p=num;
    int *q=num+2;
    int i=*p++;
    printf("%d %d %d\n",i,*p,*q );
}
#include
main() {
    int i = 2+3, 4>3, 7;
    printf(“%d”,i);
    return 0;    
}
Output:
Coding Questions :
3 numbers are given as linked list. Each node represents a digit of a number starting from left. Add the three no.s and return the result in a linked list.
Sort a linked list containing zeros, ones and twos. (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-linked-list-of-0s-1s-or-2s/)

20 MCQ, 2 Coding - 90 mins Platform - Hackerrank
MCQs:
Output of code snippet, OS,DBMS basics, Complexity estimation, basic discrete math. Gate type questions. (May be those were gate questions. I'm not sure.)
Coding Q1:
Phone Keypad=> Given pressed digits, print all possible strings that you can generate.
Coding Q2:
Evaluate Expression=>4 operators in order of precedence: (%,*,+,-); associativity is left to right. Ex: 2+43%4*3=11

20 MCQ (negative marking is there, all questions are based on OS Time Complexities DS, Programming ) Coding questions were extremely easy. 
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-linked-list-of-0s-1s-or-2s/
The following question extended to three inputs.  http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-two-linked-lists/

Amazon @IITKGP 20MCQ (neagtive marking is there, aal questions are based on OS Time Complexites DS, Programming )+2 Coding Questions
one only need to wrtie functions
1) given set of characters find all possible strings with length k using set of characters
EX; { a, b} length = 3
output : aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, bbb
2) Longest ZigZag subsequnce
A sequence of numbers is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a zig-zag sequence.
For example, 1,7,4,9,2,5 is a zig-zag sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, 1,4,7,2,5 and 1,7,4,5,5 are not zig-zag sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.
Given a sequence of integers, sequence, return the length of the longest subsequence of sequence that is a zig-zag sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
ex: 1,7,4,9,2,5 output = 6


IIIT-D Amazon Questions

1. In a 2-D sorted matrix with element sorted row-wise(top to bottom) and column-wise(left to right), write an optimal program to find a particular element.
2. reverse a linked list without recursion and with recursion(using 2 and single pointers respectively).
3. For a binary tree, print the elements in level order starting at last level up to level 0.
4. Find an unique element in a sorted array which have all the elements occuring exactly twice except one(find this element). Give an optimal solution.
5. rotate sorted array by an input value K efficiently.
6. Addition of 2 binary numbers given as an input in 2 strings.
7. For a 2-D matrix having only binary elements(0/1), find the largest submatrix with all 1's efficiently.
8. if you look at a binary tree from right side, then print all elements which are visible from right side veiw.
9. Rotate the 2D matrix clockwise and anticlockwise efficiently.
10. Find a longest common subsequence in given 2 input arrays.

Amazon@IITR

It was 90 min exam with two coding questions.. + apti.
Keypad question standard one. Twist in output printing.
Output should be in decreasing order of number but if number is same than increasing order of string.
Eg

786 run
786 sun
