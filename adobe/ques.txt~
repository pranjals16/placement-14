There were 2 sections with 10 subjective questions each Duration: 2 hrs. Some questions which I remember are:
GCD of 2 numbers recursively
2's complement of a string program
reverse doubly linked list
return pointer to the middle of linked list
draw a bst for given input of node values
question on macros
a question on telling the output for a given recursive program
LCA in bs

1) Analyse a given assembly language program and explain what it does.
2) Simplify a given boolean expression.
3) Explain a & b in a line each-
a) void (*p)(void *a[], int n)
b) void* (*p[])(void *a, int n)

1) swap 2 integer pointers
2) print command line arguments in reverse order
3) sizeof( union )
4) output of a c program with static variable
5) diff b/w calloc and malloc
6) w.a.p. to check if sum of 2 unsigned ints overflow or not
7) w.a.p. to print all possible anagrams of a string


*****there were no questions related to operating systems, computer networks or database systems
