There were 2 sections with 10 subjective questions each Duration: 2 hrs. Some questions which I remember are:
GCD of 2 numbers recursively
2's complement of a string program
reverse doubly linked list
return pointer to the middle of linked list
draw a bst for given input of node values
question on macros
a question on telling the output for a given recursive program
LCA in bs

1) Analyse a given assembly language program and explain what it does.
2) Simplify a given boolean expression.
3) Explain a & b in a line each-
a) void (*p)(void *a[], int n)	
b) void* (*p[])(void *a, int n)

1) swap 2 integer pointers
2) print command line arguments in reverse order
3) sizeof( union )
4) output of a c program with static variable
5) diff b/w calloc and malloc
6) w.a.p. to check if sum of 2 unsigned ints overflow or not
7) w.a.p. to print all possible anagrams of a string

2 Sections, 10 questions each section, total time 2 hours, Full subjective.
Paper and pen test. All questions related to CSE. No aptitude questions. No MCQ’s.

 Some questions :
some microprocessor code given, tell answer
return pointer to middle of linked list in 1 pass
Array of size n-1 has numbers 1 to n, one number missing, no number repeated, find the missing number
What is the best STL used to find matching parenthesis 
some theoretical questions on pointers and function
find max. of 3 numbers using  ? :  only
Given a Hash function, find value of keys having same hash
Given order of insertion of nodes, make BST
given 3AC, a number in base 14, convert it to base 7. (only show working on given example, no code or algo) [ ans = 2105 ]
Simplify a given boolean expression.
Explain a) & b) - 
a) void (*p)(void *a[], int n) 
b) void* (*p[])(void *a, int n)

13 GATE pattern MCQs and 7 Coding Questions
Platform : HackerRank
TIme : 2 hrs

Coding Questions:
Reverse linked list
Check balanced parentheses
Given m*n binary matrix, where each row has all 1s first and then all 0s. You need to return row number which has maximum 1s.
Every integer ending with 3 has at least one multiple which is made of only 1s. Ex. 3 has 111, 13 has 111111. Given integer n(LSD is 3), return its smallest such multiple.

MCQs:
char str1[] = “Hello”;
    char str2[] = “Hello”;
    if(str1==str2)
        cout<<”Equal”;
    else
        cout<<”Not Equal”;

char str1[]=”Hello”; 
str1[6]=’b’;
cout<<str1;
