Sally, George, and Frank were picking up their fast-food orders &#151; a burger, a plate of fries, and a slice of pizza. &quot;Who ordered what?&quot; asked the man at the counter. George said, &quot;I didn't order the pizza.&quot; The boy who ordered the fries said, &quot;Oh, I thought you did.&quot; That was all the man at the counter needed to know. Who got each order?

George got the burger, Frank got the fries, and Sally got the pizza. We know George didn't get the pizza, so he could have gotten the fries or the burger. But someone else got the fries, so George had to get the burger. Furthermore, we know that it was Frank who got the fries, because he is the only boy in the group besides George. So that leaves Sally with the pizza.
