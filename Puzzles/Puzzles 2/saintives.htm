			   This is a very old rhyming riddle. See if you can answer it by reading and thinking very carefully.<P>

<i>As I was going to Saint Ives,<br>
I crossed the path of seven wives.<br>
Every wife had seven sacks,<br>
Every sack had seven cats,<br>
Every cat had seven kittens,<br>
Kittens, cats, sacks, wives,<br>
How many were going to Saint Ives?</i>

			  Only one person was going to Saint Ives. <P>If he or she crossed the path of the seven wives, then the kittens, cats, sacks, and wives were all going in a different direction! <P>(If everyone was going in the same direction, however, the answer would be 2,801 &#151; 7 wives, 49 sacks, 343 cats, and  2,401 kittens equal 2,800. Then you have to add one more for the person speaking the words of the riddle.)
