			 Mr. Black, Mr. Brown, and Mr. White were having a conversation.<P> 
			"It's funny," said Mr. Black to the other two men, "that we are all wearing different colors, but none of us is wearing the color that is the same as his name."<P>
			"True," agreed the man who was wearing white.<P>

Use the information in this conversation to give the correct last name of the man wearing each color (black, brown, and white).

			  <!-- begin answer -->
			  
			  Since no one can be wearing the same color as his name, Mr. Black can be wearing only brown or white. Since he is talking to a man wearing white, that means Mr. Black must be wearing brown. Mr. White can be wearing only black or brown, but Mr. Black is wearing brown, so Mr. White must be wearing black. That means that Mr. Brown is the man wearing white.
