			  To answer these questions, you have to let your brain think in different ways than you may be used to. Here's an example:
<p>
<b>Question:</b> A girl who was just learning to drive went down a one-way street in the wrong direction, but didn't break the law. How come?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> She was walking.
<p>
See if you can let your brain switch directions to answer these questions:
<ol>
<li>How can you throw a ball as hard as you can and have it come back to you, even if it doesn't hit anything, there is nothing attached to it, and no one else catches or throws it?<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>Two students are sitting on opposite sides of the same desk. There is nothing in between them but the desk. Why can't they see each other?<br>&nbsp;<br>
<li>There are only two T's in Timothy Tuttle. True or false?
</ol>

<li>Throw the ball straight up in the air.<br>&nbsp;
<li>The two students have their backs to each other.<br>&nbsp;
<li>True. There are only two T's (upper case). There are also three t's (lower case).
</ol>
