Jack and Jill were practicing batting. Jack's first time at bat, he hit 75 out of a hundred pitches thrown by Jill. Then Jill hit 75 out of a hundred pitches thrown by Jack. After a little break, Jack took a second turn at bat. Jill threw him 50 pitches, and he hit 35 of them. Jill was tired, so she didn't take a second turn at bat. Who had the best average for the day &#151; Jack or Jill?

Jill had the best average. <P>She hit 75 out of 100 pitches, for an average of
75%. Jack hit 75 out of 100 pitches in his first round. Then he hit 35 out of
50 pitches in his second round. Add his hits in both rounds (75 + 35) for a
total of 110 hits. Then add the total number of pitches Jill threw to Jack
(100 in round one + 50 in round 2) for a total of 150 pitches. Finally,
divide Jack's total number of hits (110) by the total number of pitches (150)
to get his average for both rounds. <P>The result is 73.3%, which is lower than
Jill's average of 75%.
