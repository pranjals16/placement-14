In Ms. Quimby's class, everyone plays on a team. There are five more soccer players than baseball players. There are three more students on the track team than on the baseball team. There are two more football players than hockey players. There are three more students on the track team than on the football team. The number of baseball and football players equals 8. <P>How many players are on each team? How many students are there in the class?

The three key pieces of information are <b>(1)</b> there are three more students on the track team than on the baseball team; <b>(2)</b> there are three more students on the track team than on the football team (therefore the number of students on the baseball team and the football team are the same); and <b>(3)</b> the number of baseball and the number of football players equals 8. Since the two numbers are equal, there must be four players on each team. Now it's easy to figure out the rest.
