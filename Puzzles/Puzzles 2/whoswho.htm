			  Can you figure out who's who and who sits where? 
<P>
Mr. Black is a butcher, and head of the shopkeepers' club, which also includes a baker, a grocer, and a candlestick maker. At their meetings, they all sit at a square table. Mr. Black sits at the head of the table, on Ms. Brown's left. Ms. White sits on the grocer's right. Mr. Pink, who faces Ms. Brown, is not the baker. What kind of shop does Ms. White have? (Helpful hint: Draw a square or rectangle to represent the table. Keep filling in the information you learn and crossing out whatever can't be true.)

			  Draw a square or rectangle to represent the table. Write "Black/butcher" on the top side, since Black sits at the head of the table. <P>You know that Brown is on the left side of the table, and Pink is on the right, since you are told that Black sits on Brown's left, and Pink sits opposite Brown. That leaves the bottom side of the table for White. Since White sits on the grocer's right, Brown is the grocer. If Pink is not the baker, White must be the baker. That means Pink must be the candlestick maker.
