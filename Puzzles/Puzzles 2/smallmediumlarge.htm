Al, Beth, and Cynthia got sodas to drink in the movies. &quot;We want a small, a medium, and a large, and I don't get the large,&quot; Beth told the kid at the counter. &quot;I thought you said you were getting large,&quot; said the boy who wanted the medium-size drink. 
<P>
Who wanted what size drink?

Al got medium, Beth got small, and Cynthia got large. You know that Beth didn't want large, so she could have gotten small or medium. But you know that someone else wanted medium, so Beth had to get the small drink. 
<P>
You also know who got the medium-sized drink &#151; it had to be Al, because he was the only boy in the group. That means the large drink was for Cynthia.
