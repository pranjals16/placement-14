			   The Masters family is moving to a new house. They have a dog, a cat, and a pet mouse, but the animals don't get along in the car, so they can take only one at a time. <P>Then there are other problems. They can't leave the dog alone with the cat, because the dog chases the cat if no one is watching. And they can't leave the cat and the mouse together, because...well, you know what would happen if they did. <P>How can the Masters family get all three of their pets to their new house?

			  They take the cat to the new house, leaving the dog and the mouse at the old house. They return to the old house and take the mouse to the new house. They take the cat back to the old house, leave it there, and take the dog to the new house. Then they return to the old house for the cat.
