			  "It seems that all great geniuses have terrible handwriting," said Ralph, looking at a photograph of Albert Einstein's signature.<P>
	"Hey," thought Wanda to herself, "my teachers are always complaining that they can't read my handwriting. If all geniuses have terrible handwriting, I must be a genius!"
<P>
What do you think? Is Wanda really a genius? If not, what is wrong with her reasoning?

			  From the way Wanda uses logic, she's definitely not a genius. The fact that Individual A shares one characteristic of a group of individuals does not logically imply that Individual A is a member of that group. <P>Think of it this way. If Ralph had said, "All whales are good swimmers," Wanda would probably not have thought to herself, "Hey, I've always been a good swimmer. I must be a whale!" On the other hand, if Ralph had said, "All good swimmers are whales," Wanda would have had to assume either that she really was a whale or that Ralphie's statement was false.
