The probability that both are girls is 1/3.  (The odds that both are girls is 1 to 2- one way it can be true against two ways it can not.)
There are four possibilities when considering the gender of two siblings:  girl-girl, girl-boy, boy-girl, and boy-boy.  Given that I have one sister, the boy-boy combination is impossible. So in this case, there are three possible combinations, and only one with both girls.  
<P>
In the second case, the probability of having two brothers is 1/2.  (The odds are "even" - 1 to 1.)  The same four possibilities for gender must be considered.  Girl- girl is not possible from the given information.  The statement "the older one is a boy" also eliminates the girl-boy option.  This leaves only two choices.
<P>
STRATEGY:  Draw a picture or diagram.
