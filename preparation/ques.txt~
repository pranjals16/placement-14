Coding Skills:

Q1) Jack Sparrow's escape from Jail
Input :
Four arguments
(climbUp, climbDown, noWalls, wallHeights[])
climbUp : number of meters he can jump (1 <= climbUp <= 10^4)
climbDown: number of meters he slides down (1 <= climbUp <= 10^4)
noWalls : number of walls he needs to jump to escape (1 <= noWalls <= 10^4)
wallHeights[] : 1-D array containing height of each wall(1 <= height <= 10^3)
Output :
Total number of jumps to output variable output1

Ex :
Input: 5:1:2:{9,10}
Here Jack Sparrow can jump height of 5 meters, but slides down by 1 meter. He has 2 walls to jump and the height of each wall is 9 and 10 meteres, resp. For 1st wall he needs two attempts(5m up-> 1m down-> 5m up) to cross it. In the same way he needs 3 attempts to cross 2nd wall. SO total 5 attempt.
Q2) The Pizzeria Problem
One pizzeria staff member has to serve "n" number of customers. He can serve one pizza at a time. Each customers pizza receiving time, and time taken to come back to the pizzeria are given. You have to find out maximum number of possible pizza deliveries.
Note :TIme taken by the delivery boy to customer is negligible

Input:
N : Number of customers
a[N] : Pizza receiving time
b[N] : Time needed to come back to pizzeria after delivering to ith customer
Output:
Maximum Number of orders that can be fulfilled using the scheduling you made

Ex :
Input : 5 {3 6 1 4 7} {5 8 4 7 10}
output: 3 (Explanation : a[2]->a[3]->a[4])

Some more coding questions:

1). Get next prime number for input n

2). Problem reduced to square of fibonacci number for input n

3). Count number of inversions..

4). Nim Game

5). given preorder, inorder, calculate postorder..
6). N clothes each of a given length and hanging on a rope at position i, calculate number of clothes finally visible..
Example: (2,4) (1,3) (3,5) : output is 2 2nd and 3rd cloth will be visible..
7). A number x is mapped to 'x + (number of 1 bits in x)'
Calculate from the given array, the count of numbers which can't be mapped in this way..
For example: 3 is mapped to 5, 2 is mapped to 3..
So, 5 and 3 can be mapped by some number.. But 4 can't be mapped.

8). Find max number of characters(excluding whitespaces) between two occurrences of a given character in a given string, and if given character is not in the string or appear once then return -1.
9). Two player Game: You are given N stacks, each stack contain certain number of balls. A player first choose one stack and can remove 1 or more balls from it. Return 1 if player1(1st one to play) wins 2 otherwise. Both the players are playing optimally.

10). Question boiled down to finding sum of all numbers in the nth row of the Pascal's triangle (2 ^ n).

11). You are given a large cake, you can make n (<= 10 ^ 9) vertical cuts, what is the maximum number of pieces you can make modulo 10^9 + 7. (You can double the number of pieces in each cut by stacking the pieces upon each other and then making a cut. So answer is 2 ^ n modulo 10^9+7). Both the questions had the same answer! Only difference: n was small enough for a one line solution in the first question.

12) given array of integers and sum, find in how many ways you can select subset of array whose sum is given sum.

13) given array of 10^6 positions, initially 0, perform queries. Query is to increment given position by 1. Each query was followed by some start and end positions, give sum of sub-array for each query.
